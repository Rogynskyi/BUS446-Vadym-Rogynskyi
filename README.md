The Data set that we are using -measures and evaluates and ranks 165 of the worlds' nations Economic Freedom based on 5 major criteria of Size of Government, Legal System & Prop. Rights, Sound Money, Freedom to Trade Internationally, and Regulation. Also, we can find a country that we want to look for and choose the specific year. We explored more which country has the highest economic freedom in 2022 and which criteria, factors- influenced economic freedom the most. Also, we have observed which combination of size and government, and turnover rate would lead to a stronger economy. And we saw how economic freedom score has changed from 1970-2022.
